# Secure API with JWT and Crypto

This is an example of securing a Node.js API using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, and `crypto` for additional security. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. We use `crypto` to hash sensitive data and add security layers to the API.
